Welcome! I'm **Hao Zhang**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the **University of Glasgow**, where I am supervised by **Prof. Michael Wemyss**.

I am an **algebraic geometer** investigating geometric objects through tools from **commutative** and **noncommutative algebra**. My work centers on **resolutions of singularities**, **deformation theory**, **curve invariants**, and their connections to **representation theory**. My research contributes to classification problems in the **Minimal Model Program**, with a focus on 3-fold singularities and their associated algebraic structures.

In parallel, I explore the synergy between **pure mathematics and machine learning**, combining geometric and algebraic perspectives with computational approaches. I am particularly interested in:

- Geometric and algebraic structures of neural network function spaces  
- Multiview geometry and its algebraic foundations  
- Equivariance, symmetry, and invariant theory in machine learning  
- Topological data analysis and optimization on manifolds

- Noncommutative Algebra and Deformation Theory  
- Curve Invariants and Representation Theory

## Current Projects

ðŸ“„ *Local Forms for the Double $$A_n$$ Quiver* ([arXiv:2412.10042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10042)):  
Studies the noncommutative singularity theory of the double An quiver, proving a monomialization result and identifying their correspondence to crepant resolutions of $$cA_n$$ singularities.

ðŸ“„ *Gopakumarâ€“Vafa Invariants of Crepant Resolutions of*  $$cA_n$$ *Singularities* (in preparation):  
Develops and generalizes GV invariants to crepant partial resolutions of $$cA_n$$ singularities, showing their connection to contraction algebras and Todaâ€™s formula.

ðŸ”¬ **Research Outlook**:  
I am currently working to **generalize the techniques and results** developed for $$cA_n$$ singularities to **Type D and E compound Du Val (cDV) singularities**. This includes extending monomialization methods, understanding contraction algebras in more complex settings, and computing generalized GV invariants for these higher types.

## Interdisciplinary Work

ðŸ“Š I developed a **life expectancy prediction model** using U.S. state data from the 1970s, applying **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** and linear regression in **R**. This project included:
- Identifying key predictors through variable selection (e.g. murder rates, high school graduation rates, frost days)
- Performing exploratory data analysis, correlation matrices, and scatter plots
- Building and comparing hierarchical models using **JAGS** and **DIC**
- Visualizing residuals and regional effects to validate model fit

ðŸ“ˆ I also conducted a **Python-based longitudinal data analysis** of NHS England antidepressant prescriptions (2021â€“2024). This involved:
- Cleaning and aggregating multi-year prescription datasets
- Identifying top-prescribed and high-cost drugs
- Visualizing national and regional trends using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**
- Analyzing cost-volume tradeoffs and highlighting outliers (e.g. Vortioxetine vs. Sertraline)
